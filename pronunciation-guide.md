## Vowels

Dutch distinguishes between **short** and **long** vowels. This distinction is critical — it changes word meanings.

### Short Vowels

| Letter | IPA | Approximate English Sound | Example Words |
|--------|-----|--------------------------|---------------|
| **a** | /ɑ/ | "ah" as in "father" (shorter) | **man** (man), **kat** (cat), **dag** (day) |
| **e** | /ɛ/ | "eh" as in "bed" | **bed** (bed), **met** (with), **lek** (leak) |
| **i** | /ɪ/ | "ih" as in "bit" | **dit** (this), **vis** (fish), **kin** (chin) |
| **o** | /ɔ/ | "oh" as in "lot" (British) | **pot** (pot), **bos** (forest), **vol** (full) |
| **u** | /ʏ/ | between "uh" and "oo" — round your lips and say "ih" | **bus** (bus), **mus** (sparrow), **put** (well) |

### Long Vowels

Long vowels are spelled two ways: **doubled in a closed syllable** (aa, ee, oo, uu) or **single in an open syllable** (ma-ken, le-zen).

| Letter | IPA | Approximate English Sound | Example Words |
|--------|-----|--------------------------|---------------|
| **aa / a** | /aː/ | "ah" as in "father" (longer) | **maan** (moon), **naam** (name), **praten** (to talk) |
| **ee / e** | /eː/ | "ay" as in "say" (without the y glide) | **been** (leg), **meer** (lake), **lezen** (to read) |
| **ie** | /iː/ | "ee" as in "see" | **niet** (not), **zien** (to see), **drie** (three) |
| **oo / o** | /oː/ | "oh" as in "go" (without the w glide) | **boon** (bean), **rood** (red), **wonen** (to live) |
| **uu / u** | /yː/ | say "ee" with rounded lips | **muur** (wall), **uur** (hour), **minuut** (minute) |

> **Key rule**: In a closed syllable (ending in a consonant), you double the vowel to make it long: *man* (short a) vs. *maan* (long aa). In an open syllable (ending in a vowel), a single letter is already long: *ma-nen* (men) has a long a.

## Diphthongs

Diphthongs are combinations of two vowel sounds gliding together.

| Letters | IPA | Approximate Sound | Example Words |
|---------|-----|-------------------|---------------|
| **ij / ei** | /ɛi/ | "ay" as in "say" (these two spellings sound identical) | **wijn** (wine), **trein** (train), **vrij** (free) |
| **ui** | /œy/ | no English equivalent — start with "uh," round lips toward "oo" | **huis** (house), **tuin** (garden), **uit** (out) |
| **ou / au** | /ɑu/ | "ow" as in "how" | **oud** (old), **blauw** (blue), **auto** (car) |
| **oe** | /uː/ | "oo" as in "moon" | **boek** (book), **goed** (good), **moe** (tired) |
| **eu** | /øː/ | say "ay" with rounded lips | **deur** (door), **neus** (nose), **leuk** (fun/nice) |
| **aai** | /aːi/ | "ah" + "ee" | **draai** (turn), **mooi** (beautiful — sometimes written ooi) |
| **ooi** | /oːi/ | "oh" + "ee" | **mooi** (beautiful), **nooit** (never) |
| **oei** | /ui/ | "oo" + "ee" | **moeite** (effort), **groeien** (to grow) |

## Consonants

Most Dutch consonants sound like English. Here are the ones that differ:

### The Dutch G and CH

The most iconic Dutch sound. Both **g** and **ch** are pronounced the same way in standard (northern) Dutch.

| Letters | IPA | How to Produce It | Example Words |
|---------|-----|-------------------|---------------|
| **g** | /x/ or /ɣ/ | Like you're clearing your throat — a raspy sound from the back of the mouth | **goed** (good), **gaan** (to go), **dag** (day) |
| **ch** | /x/ | Same as g | **nacht** (night), **licht** (light), **echt** (real) |

> **Regional note**: In the south (Belgium, Limburg), g/ch are softer, more like a gentle "h." Both pronunciations are correct.

### Other Notable Consonants

| Letter | IPA | Notes | Example Words |
|--------|-----|-------|---------------|
| **w** | /ʋ/ | Between English "v" and "w" — lips barely touch | **water** (water), **wat** (what), **wij** (we) |
| **v** | /v/ or /f/ | Like English "v" but sometimes devoiced to "f" | **vader** (father), **van** (of/from), **vijf** (five) |
| **r** | /r/ or /ʁ/ | Varies by region: rolled (tongue tip), guttural (back of throat), or English-like. All are accepted | **rood** (red), **door** (through), **water** (water) |
| **j** | /j/ | Like English "y" in "yes" | **ja** (yes), **jong** (young), **jaar** (year) |
| **sch** | /sx/ | "s" + Dutch "ch" — two sounds in sequence | **school** (school), **schip** (ship), **schrijven** (to write) |
| **ng** | /ŋ/ | Like English "ng" in "sing" (never a hard g after) | **lang** (long), **zingen** (to sing) |
| **nk** | /ŋk/ | Like English "nk" in "think" | **denken** (to think), **drinken** (to drink) |
| **tj** | /tʲ/ | "t" + soft "y" | **katje** (kitten), **potje** (little pot) |

### Final Devoicing

Dutch **devoices consonants at the end of a word**. This is important:

| Written | Pronounced as | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| **-d** | /t/ | **hond** (dog) sounds like "hont" |
| **-b** | /p/ | **web** (web) sounds like "wep" |
| **-g** | /x/ | **dag** (day) — final g sounds like ch |

> You can hear the true consonant when a vowel follows: *hond* → *honden* (dogs) — the "d" comes back.

## Stress Patterns

- Most Dutch words are stressed on the **first syllable**: **WA**-ter, **huis**-je, **vrouw**-en
- Prefixes **be-**, **ge-**, **ver-**, **her-**, **ont-**, **er-** are usually **unstressed**: be-**GRIJ**-pen, ver-**STAAN**
- Words borrowed from French often keep later stress: stu-**DENT**, mu-**ZIEK**, res-tau-**RANT**

---

## Spelling Rules

### Doubled Consonants

When a short vowel needs to stay short in an open syllable, the consonant is doubled:

- **man** → **mannen** (men) — "nn" keeps the "a" short
- **kat** → **katten** (cats) — "tt" keeps the "a" short

### Single Vowels in Open Syllables

A single vowel in an open syllable is automatically long:

- **manen** (moons) — single "a" in open syllable = long "aa" sound
- **bomen** (trees) — single "o" in open syllable = long "oo" sound

### F/V and S/Z Alternation

- Some words alternate between **f** and **v**, or **s** and **z**, when going from singular to plural:
  - **brief** → **brieven** (letters)
  - **huis** → **huizen** (houses)

## Quick Reference: Sounds That Trip Up English Speakers

1. **u / uu** — Not like English "oo." Round your lips and say "ee"
2. **ui** — The hardest Dutch sound. Practice with *huis*, *tuin*, *uit*
3. **g / ch** — The guttural sound. Start gentle, don't force it
4. **ij / ei** — These are the same sound! Don't try to make them different
5. **oe** — This is the "oo" sound (like "moon"), not "oh-eh"
6. **r** — Any style is fine. Don't stress about this one
7. **Final devoicing** — *hond* rhymes with "font," not "fond"
