## Final Devoicing Rules

Dutch systematically devoices consonants at word boundaries.

| Voiced | Voiceless at End | Example | Proof (Vowel Follows) |
|--------|-----------------|---------|----------------------|
| /d/ | /t/ | hond → [hɔnt] (dog) | honden [ˈhɔndən] (dogs) |
| /b/ | /p/ | web → [ʋɛp] (web) | webben [ˈʋɛbən] (webs) |
| /ɣ/ | /x/ | dag → [dɑx] (day) | dagen [ˈdaːɣən] (days) |
| /v/ | /f/ | brief → [brif] (letter) | brieven [ˈbrivən] (letters) |
| /z/ | /s/ | huis → [hœys] (house) | huizen [ˈhœyzən] (houses) |

## Assimilation Rules

When consonants are next to each other, they often influence each other.

| Rule | Example | Pronunciation |
|------|---------|---------------|
| Voicing assimilation | zakdoek (handkerchief) | /ˈzɑɡduːk/ — "k" becomes "g" before "d" |
| Nasal assimilation | inpakken (to pack) | /ˈɪmpɑkən/ — "n" becomes "m" before "p" |
| Degemination | uittreden (to resign) | /ˈœytreːdən/ — double "t" simplifies |
