## What Is the IPA?

The **International Phonetic Alphabet** (IPA) is a universal system for writing down the sounds of any language. Unlike regular spelling, where one letter can represent many sounds (think of English "a" in *cat*, *cake*, *call*), each IPA symbol represents exactly one sound. This makes it the most reliable way to know how a Dutch word is pronounced — even before you hear it.

### How to Read IPA Notation

- **Slashes** `/…/` indicate the intended pronunciation (phonemic): `/maːn/`
- **Square brackets** `[…]` indicate the actual spoken sound (phonetic): `[maːn]`
- **ː** (colon) means the vowel is held longer: `/aː/` is a long *a*
- **ˈ** (vertical tick before a syllable) marks primary stress: `/ˈmaː.nən/` — stress on *maa*
- **.** (dot) separates syllables: `/ˈmaː.nən/` = *maa-nen*

### Quick Reference: Common IPA Symbols

| IPA Symbol | Sounds Like | Example | IPA |
|------------|-------------|---------|-----|
| `/ɑ/` | "ah" (short) | man | `/mɑn/` |
| `/aː/` | "ah" (long) | maan | `/maːn/` |
| `/ɛ/` | "eh" as in bed | bed | `/bɛt/` |
| `/eː/` | "ay" without the glide | been | `/beːn/` |
| `/ə/` | "uh" (unstressed, like *the*) | de | `/də/` |
| `/ɪ/` | "ih" as in bit | dit | `/dɪt/` |
| `/iː/` | "ee" as in see | niet | `/niːt/` |
| `/ɔ/` | "oh" (short, British *lot*) | pot | `/pɔt/` |
| `/oː/` | "oh" (long, no glide) | boon | `/boːn/` |
| `/ʏ/` | "ih" with rounded lips | bus | `/bʏs/` |
| `/yː/` | "ee" with rounded lips | muur | `/myːr/` |
| `/øː/` | "ay" with rounded lips | deur | `/døːr/` |
| `/x/` | throat clearing (Scottish *loch*) | goed | `/ɣut/` |
| `/ʋ/` | between English "v" and "w" | water | `/ˈʋaː.tər/` |

## The Big Picture

Dutch has a compact but precise sound system. Here's the inventory at a glance:

| Category | Count | Key Point |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Monophthongs | 12 | Every basic vowel has a short + long pair |
| Diphthongs | 6 | Three core (/ɛi/, /œy/, /ɑu/) + three long (/aːi/, /oːi/, /ui/) |
| Consonants | ~23 | Most match English — only a handful don't |

### Sounds with No English Equivalent

These five sounds are where learners spend most of their effort. Listen and compare:

| Sound | IPA | Hear It | Quick Approximation |
|-------|-----|---------|---------------------|
| uu | /yː/ | <Say text="muur" /> | Say "ee" with tightly rounded lips |
| eu | /øː/ | <Say text="deur" /> | Say "ay" with rounded lips (like French *eu*) |
| ui | /œy/ | <Say text="huis" /> | No shortcut — starts like "eu" and glides up |
| Short u | /ʏ/ | <Say text="bus" /> | Say "ih" with rounded lips |
| g/ch | /x/ | <Say text="goed" /> | Like clearing your throat (like Scottish *loch*) |

### The #1 Rule: Open and Closed Syllables

Dutch spelling is predictable once you know this: **a single vowel in a closed syllable is short; in an open syllable it's long.** This one rule explains most spelling changes.

| Word | Syllable Type | Vowel | IPA |
|------|--------------|-------|-----|
| man | closed (CVC) | short *a* | `/mɑn/` |
| maan | closed + doubled vowel | long *aa* | `/maːn/` |
| ma-nen | open (CV-) | long *a* | `/ˈmaː.nən/` |
| man-nen | closed (CVC) | short *a* | `/ˈmɑ.nən/` |

See [Patterns & Rules](/dutch/grammar/patterns-rules/) for the full spelling system that follows from this principle.

## Vowel Chart

Every basic vowel comes in a short + long pair. Three vowels — /ʏ/, /yː/, and /øː/ — have no English equivalent because they combine front tongue position with rounded lips.

### Monophthongs (Pure Vowels)

| IPA | Dutch Spelling | Tongue Position | Lip Shape | Dutch | English |
|-----|---------------|----------------|-----------|-------|---------|
| /ɑ/ | a | open, back | unrounded | man | like "father" but shorter |
| /aː/ | aa, a (open syllable) | open, front | unrounded | maan | like "father" held longer |
| /ɛ/ | e | mid-open, front | unrounded | bed | like "bed" |
| /eː/ | ee, e (open syllable) | mid-close, front | unrounded | been | like "say" without the glide |
| /ə/ | e (unstressed) | mid-central | neutral | de | like "the" in English |
| /ɪ/ | i | near-close, front | unrounded | dit | like "bit" |
| /iː/ | ie | close, front | unrounded | niet | like "see" |
| /ɔ/ | o | mid-open, back | rounded | pot | like British "lot" |
| /oː/ | oo, o (open syllable) | mid-close, back | rounded | boon | like "go" without the glide |
| /ʏ/ | u | near-close, front | rounded | bus | <Say text="bus" /> say "ih" with rounded lips |
| /yː/ | uu, u (open syllable) | close, front | rounded | muur | <Say text="muur" /> say "ee" with rounded lips |
| /øː/ | eu | mid-close, front | rounded | deur | <Say text="deur" /> say "ay" with rounded lips |

### Diphthongs (Gliding Vowels)

| IPA | Dutch Spelling | Starting Position | Glides Toward | Dutch | English |
|-----|---------------|-------------------|--------------|-------|---------|
| /ɛi/ | ij, ei | mid-open front | close front | wijn | like "say" |
| /œy/ | ui | mid-open front rounded | close front rounded | huis | <Say text="huis" /> no English equivalent |
| /ɑu/ | ou, au | open back | close back rounded | oud | like "how" |
| /aːi/ | aai | open front long | close front | draai | "ah" + "ee" |
| /oːi/ | ooi | mid-close back long | close front | mooi | "oh" + "ee" |
| /ui/ | oei | close back rounded | close front | moeite | "oo" + "ee" |

:::tip[Vowel length matters]
Getting vowel length wrong is the #1 source of misunderstanding. *Man* (man) vs. *maan* (moon) are completely different words. Practice the [minimal pairs](#short-vs-long-vowels) below until you can hear the difference reliably.

## Consonant Chart

Most Dutch consonants match English. Three don't: **g/ch** (the throat sound), **w** (between English "v" and "w"), and **r** (which varies by region).

### Plosives (Stop Consonants)

The airflow is completely blocked, then released.

| IPA | Dutch Spelling | Place | Voicing | Dutch | English |
|-----|---------------|-------|---------|-------|---------|
| /p/ | p | bilabial (both lips) | voiceless | pak | like English "p" |
| /b/ | b | bilabial | voiced | bad | like English "b" |
| /t/ | t | alveolar (tongue tip behind teeth) | voiceless | tak | like English "t" |
| /d/ | d | alveolar | voiced | dag | like English "d" |
| /k/ | k | velar (back of tongue) | voiceless | kat | like English "k" |

### Fricatives (Continuous Airflow)

Air is pushed through a narrow gap.

| IPA | Dutch Spelling | Place | Voicing | Dutch | English |
|-----|---------------|-------|---------|-------|---------|
| /f/ | f | labiodental (lip + teeth) | voiceless | fiets | like English "f" |
| /v/ | v | labiodental | voiced | vader | like English "v" |
| /s/ | s | alveolar | voiceless | soep | like English "s" |
| /z/ | z | alveolar | voiced | zon | like English "z" |
| /x/ | g, ch | velar/uvular | voiceless | goed | like clearing your throat |
| /ɣ/ | g (between vowels) | velar/uvular | voiced | vragen | softer version of /x/ |
| /ɦ/ | h | glottal | voiced | huis | like English "h" but softer |
| /ʃ/ | sj, sh | postalveolar | voiceless | sjaal | like English "sh" |
| /ʒ/ | j (in loanwords) | postalveolar | voiced | journaal | like "s" in "measure" |

### Nasals

Air flows through the nose.

| IPA | Dutch Spelling | Place | Dutch | English |
|-----|---------------|-------|-------|---------|
| /m/ | m | bilabial | moeder | like English "m" |
| /n/ | n | alveolar | naam | like English "n" |
| /ŋ/ | ng | velar | lang | like "ng" in "sing" |

### Approximants & Liquids

| IPA | Dutch Spelling | Place | Dutch | English |
|-----|---------------|-------|-------|---------|
| /ʋ/ | w | labiodental | water | between English "v" and "w" |
| /j/ | j | palatal | ja | like English "y" in "yes" |
| /l/ | l | alveolar lateral | land | like English "l" |
| /r/ | r | varies by dialect | rood | rolled, uvular, or English-like |

### The Dutch R — Three Accepted Variants

| Variant | IPA | Where | How to Produce |
|---------|-----|-------|---------------|
| Alveolar trill | /r/ | Traditionally standard | Tongue tip vibrates against the ridge behind the teeth |
| Uvular trill | /ʁ/ | Randstad (Amsterdam, Rotterdam) | Back of tongue vibrates against the uvula |
| Approximant | /ɹ/ | Informal/younger speakers | Similar to American English "r" |

All three are accepted in standard Dutch. Use whichever feels most natural.

### Articulatory Tips for Hard Sounds

**The g/ch sound** /x/: Start by whispering "h" but pull your tongue back until you feel friction in your throat. If you speak German, it's like the *ch* in *Buch*. If you speak Scottish English, it's the *ch* in *loch*. Practice: <Say text="goed" /> <Say text="nacht" /> <Say text="acht" />

**The w sound** /ʋ/: Place your upper teeth lightly on your lower lip (like starting an English "v") but don't fully commit to the contact — let air flow loosely. It's softer than English "v" but firmer than English "w". Practice: <Say text="water" /> <Say text="weten" /> <Say text="waar" />

### Consonant Clusters

Dutch loves stacking consonants. These clusters are common and worth drilling:

| Cluster | IPA | Example | IPA | Meaning |
|---------|-----|---------|-----|---------|
| sch | /sx/ | school | `/sxoːl/` | school |
| schr | /sxr/ | schrijven | `/ˈsxrɛi.vən/` | to write |
| str | /str/ | straat | `/straːt/` | street |
| spr | /spr/ | spreken | `/ˈspreː.kən/` | to speak |
| thr | /tr/ | drie | `/driː/` | three |

See [Cognates & Borrowed Words](/dutch/vocabulary/cognates/) for familiar words where you can practice hearing these consonant patterns.

## The Open/Closed Syllable Rule

This is the single most important spelling-pronunciation rule in Dutch. Once you internalize it, you can predict pronunciation from spelling — and vice versa.

### The Core Principle

| Syllable Type | Vowel Length | Spelling | Example | IPA |
|---------------|-------------|----------|---------|-----|
| **Closed** (ends in consonant) | Short | Single vowel | man | `/mɑn/` |
| **Closed** (ends in consonant) | Long | Double vowel | maan | `/maːn/` |
| **Open** (ends in vowel) | Long | Single vowel | ma-nen | `/ˈmaː.nən/` |

### How Spelling Reflects It

When you add a suffix (like a plural), the syllable structure changes, and the spelling adjusts to preserve the vowel sound:

| Base | IPA | Plural | IPA | What Happens |
|------|-----|--------|-----|-------------|
| maan | `/maːn/` | manen | `/ˈmaː.nən/` | Drop one *a* — syllable opens, single *a* is already long |
| man | `/mɑn/` | mannen | `/ˈmɑ.nən/` | Double the *n* — keeps syllable closed, preserving short *a* |
| boot | `/boːt/` | boten | `/ˈboː.tən/` | Drop one *o* — syllable opens, single *o* is already long |
| bot | `/bɔt/` | botten | `/ˈbɔ.tən/` | Double the *t* — keeps syllable closed, preserving short *o* |

**Practical implication:** If you can split a word into syllables, you can predict every vowel length — and therefore the pronunciation. This rule also drives verb stem formation; see [Verbs: Present Tense](/dutch/grammar/verbs-present-tense/) and [Patterns & Rules](/dutch/grammar/patterns-rules/) for more.

## Minimal Pairs

Minimal pairs are word pairs that differ by just one sound. They are the best way to train your ear.

### Short vs. Long Vowels

| Dutch | IPA | Dutch | IPA |
|-------|-----|-------|-----|
| man | `/mɑn/` | maan | `/maːn/` |
| bed | `/bɛt/` | beet | `/beːt/` |
| bos | `/bɔs/` | boos | `/boːs/` |
| mus | `/mʏs/` | muur | `/myːr/` |

### Commonly Confused Sounds

| Dutch | IPA | Dutch | IPA |
|-------|-----|-------|-----|
| vuur | `/vyːr/` | vier | `/viːr/` |
| deur | `/døːr/` | deer | `/deːr/` |
| huis | `/hœys/` | hijs | `/hɛis/` |
| veel | `/veːl/` | feel | `/feːl/` |
| zee | `/zeː/` | see | `/seː/` |

### Rounded vs. Unrounded Vowels

The distinction between rounded and unrounded front vowels is unique to Dutch (and similar to French/German). Compare:

| Dutch | IPA | Dutch | IPA |
|-------|-----|-------|-----|
| buur | `/byːr/` | boer | `/buːr/` |
| deur | `/døːr/` | deer | `/deːr/` |
| bus | `/bʏs/` | bis | `/bɪs/` |

### Consonant Pairs

| Dutch | IPA | Dutch | IPA |
|-------|-----|-------|-----|
| veel | `/veːl/` | feel | `/feːl/` |
| gaan | `/ɣaːn/` | haan | `/ɦaːn/` |

---

## Final Devoicing Rules

All voiced consonants become voiceless at the end of a word — the plural or inflected form reveals the true underlying sound.

| Voiced | Voiceless at End | Example | IPA | Proof (Vowel Follows) | IPA |
|--------|-----------------|---------|-----|-----------------------|-----|
| /d/ | /t/ | hond | `/hɔnt/` | honden | `/ˈhɔn.dən/` |
| /b/ | /p/ | web | `/ʋɛp/` | webben | `/ˈʋɛ.bən/` |
| /ɣ/ | /x/ | dag | `/dɑx/` | dagen | `/ˈdaː.ɣən/` |
| /v/ | /f/ | brief | `/brif/` | brieven | `/ˈbri.vən/` |
| /z/ | /s/ | huis | `/hœys/` | huizen | `/ˈhœy.zən/` |

This is why verb stems sometimes look different from what you'd expect — see [Patterns & Rules](/dutch/grammar/patterns-rules/) for how this interacts with verb conjugation.

---

## Assimilation Rules

Assimilation happens automatically in fast speech — don't fight it. Let your mouth take the natural shortcut.

| Rule | Example | IPA | Pronunciation |
|------|---------|-----|---------------|
| Voicing assimilation | zakdoek | `/ˈzɑɡ.duːk/` | "k" becomes "g" before "d" |
| Nasal assimilation | inpakken | `/ˈɪm.pɑ.kən/` | "n" becomes "m" before "p" |
| Degemination | uittreden | `/ˈœyt.reː.dən/` | double "t" simplifies |
