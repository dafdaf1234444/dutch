:::note[CEFR deck card counts]
The **CEFR A1** and **CEFR A2** decks exclude words already covered in the topic-specific decks (Greetings, Numbers, Food, etc.). This cross-deck deduplication means the CEFR decks contain fewer cards than the full source word lists (A1: ~86 of 298 source words; A2: ~297 of 549 source words).
